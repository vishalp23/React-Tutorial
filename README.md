## useState 
UseState Component
The UseState component is a simple demonstration of using the useState hook in React to manage state within a functional component.

### Import Statements
The component imports React and the useState hook from the React library.
### State Initialization
The state variable emotion is initialized with the value "happy". The setEmotion function is used to update the state.
### Render Method
The component renders a div containing a heading and two buttons.
The heading displays the current emotion.
The buttons allow the user to change the emotion to "sad" or "excited" by updating the state using the setEmotion function.
